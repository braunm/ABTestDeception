## News

The working paper is available on [SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3896024)


The goal of ABTestDeception is to illustrate the effects of divergent delivery and response heterogeneity on bias in results of online advertising A/B tests, as described in Braun and Schwartz (2021).


## Now, with a Shiny App!!!!

To avoid lots of issues with hosting, authentication, credentials, etc., we're just going to share the app as an R package.  Once installed and loaded, you can run the app with just one command.

### Installation

You can install the released version of ABTestDeception from github

``` r
install_github("braunm/ABTestDeception")
```

### Running the app

Once you have installed the package, load the package and launch the app

``` r
library(ABTestDeception)
ABTestDeception::launch()
```
